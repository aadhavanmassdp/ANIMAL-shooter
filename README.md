# Java script Console Games

This repository contains multiple **Java console-based games**, created to practice programming logic, loops, arrays, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.  

## Games Included
- **Bird Shouting Game** – A simple reaction-based game where the player responds to bird sounds (or text prompts).  
- **Car Racing Simulation** – A console-based car game simulating movement, speed, and race progress.  
- **Snake Game (Console Version)** – Classic snake game where the snake grows as it eats food and ends when it collides.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (Core Java)  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Game Mechanics:** Implemented using loops, conditionals, arrays, and console input/output.  
- **IDE Used:** Any (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, or CLI with `javac`)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-console-games.git
   cd java-console-games
````

2. Navigate to the desired game folder (e.g., `SnakeGame/`):

   ```bash
   cd SnakeGame
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## 🎮 Features

* **Bird Shouting Game**

  * Player reacts to text prompts (bird sounds).
  * Score tracking for correct responses.

* **Car Racing Game**

  * Simulates acceleration, braking, and race progress.
  * Player input decides car actions.

* **Snake Game**

  * Snake grows as it eats food.
  * Collision with wall or self ends the game.
  * Score system included.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Practice **loops, conditionals, and arrays**
* Learn to implement **basic game logic** in console
* Strengthen **OOP principles** (classes like Bird, Car, Snake, Food, etc.)
* Handle **user input** with Scanner
